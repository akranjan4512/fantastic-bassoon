As a Business Development Manager at Infinera Tech., a software developer focused on middleware for the IT &amp; Telecom industry. In this role I lead the company’s B2B marketing efforts, overseeing a team of four marketing and sales professionals and managing the annual spend. Our most exciting work to date was creating a social media and online advertising campaign that generated enormous media buzz and was key to the successful launch of the Zingo software in 2019. Not only did we have fun creating that campaign, but also we found it rewarding to see the results.  Before joining Infinera, I worked for marketing agency — VAP Technology and was lucky enough to work with amazing clients such as Flipkart, Sony Music, and Vodafone.  I’m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other marketers. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the client or business unit leader to understand his or her business objectives in Branding and Business Development. As we go through that collaborative process, the ideas start to flow and that’s always the fun part.
